# PZTools logs and useful issue reports

This reference applies to PZWorldEd, TileZed, and BuildingEd in the portable
PZTools distribution.

## Log location

Each application writes a new UTF-8 log under:

```text
PZTools-Qt5-Latest/
`-- settings/
    `-- logs/
        |-- PZWorldEd-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-mmm-PID.log
        |-- TileZed-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-mmm-PID.log
        `-- BuildingEd-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-mmm-PID.log
```

The newest 20 files per application are retained. A new session never appends
to an unrelated older log.

The first lines identify the log path, installation root, active
configuration directory, settings file, operating system, CPU, logical
processor count, total and available RAM, display adapters, Qt version, ABI,
and process bitness.

No username, hostname, serial number, IP address, or stable hardware identifier
is collected. Remote desktop sessions can expose only the remote display
adapter. When WorldEd creates an OpenGL context, it also records the actual
OpenGL vendor, renderer, and version selected by the driver.

## Reading a log line

```text
2026-08-03 17:52:43.735 [INFO] [pid:16620 thread:2f34 name:MiniMapRenderWorker] message
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Timestamp | Local date and time with milliseconds |
| `DEBUG` | Detailed support information around an operation |
| `INFO` | Normal startup, selected paths, counts, phases, and completion |
| `WARNING` | Recoverable issue, missing optional data, rejected entry, or fallback |
| `CRITICAL` | The requested operation could not complete |
| `FATAL` | Process-ending Qt failure |
| PID | Exact process that wrote the file |
| Thread and name | UI, reader, renderer, or worker context |

An unhandled Windows exception is recorded with its exception code, address,
module path, and module-relative offset when Windows provides them.

## Normal startup

The editors intentionally discover and preload the complete valid Tiles
catalogue. A large 2x installation can take several seconds and use multiple
gigabytes of memory. Normal logs include discovery, registration, decoding,
loaded and missing totals, and timing summaries.

- **loaded** means a readable PNG resolved and decoded.
- **missing** means neither supported scale resolved and a placeholder is used.
- **unresolved** means metadata exists but no readable image was confirmed.
- **invalid** means image geometry, metadata, or encoded data was rejected.

Only the exact libpng warning `iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile` is
suppressed. Other PNG warnings and errors remain visible.

If Windows reports **Bad Image** before a window opens, the runtime can fail
before the logger starts. Record the named DLL, then re-extract the release
before changing preferences.

## Rules and Blends delays

TileZed records slow BMP Rules regeneration. These messages concern the
terrain `Rules.txt` imported through BMP Tools, not an Automapper manifest.

Each TMX contains one Rules snapshot and one Blends snapshot. Import replaces
the selected snapshot in memory. Saving persists the replacement. Reload after
Import is unnecessary. Identical imports are treated as a no-op.

Older TMX files can retain unresolved tileset references. Removing only the
tilesets that no longer resolve to a PNG can reduce unnecessary rule work.
Project Doctor can inspect and repair those references with a backup.

## Reproducing a problem

1. Close unrelated PZTools instances.
2. Start the executable from the current release `bin` directory.
3. Perform the shortest sequence that reproduces the issue.
4. Close the application normally when possible.
5. Select the newest log for that application and PID.
6. Keep the complete log for crashes and startup failures.

## Useful issue report

Include:

- application name and release
- exact steps
- expected and observed behavior
- newest matching log
- relevant PZW, TMX, TBX, PNG, Rules, Blends, Lua, `.tiles`, or `.pack` file
- project grid format when relevant
- screenshot for visual or layout issues
- Raster and OpenGL behavior when rendering is involved
- approximate map dimensions and brush size for performance issues

Do not include personal information that is unrelated to the problem.
