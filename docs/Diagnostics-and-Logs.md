# PZTools logs, diagnostics, and useful issue reports

This reference applies to PZWorldEd, TileZed, and BuildingEd in the portable
PZTools distribution.

## Where logs are stored

Each application writes a new UTF-8 log at startup:

```text
PZTools-Qt5-Latest/
└── settings/
    └── logs/
        ├── PZWorldEd-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-mmm-PID.log
        ├── TileZed-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-mmm-PID.log
        └── BuildingEd-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-mmm-PID.log
```

The logger retains the newest 20 files per application. A new run never
appends to an unrelated older session.

The first lines identify:

- the exact log path;
- the portable installation root;
- the application configuration directory;
- the active INI file.

This makes it possible to detect a copied executable, a mixed release, or a
different portable installation immediately.

## How to read a log line

```text
2026-08-03 17:52:43.735 [INFO] [pid:16620 thread:2f34 name:MiniMapRenderWorker] message
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Timestamp | Local date and time, including milliseconds. |
| `DEBUG` | Developer detail. Usually useful only around the failing operation. |
| `INFO` | Normal startup, selected paths, counts, phases, and successful validations. |
| `WARNING` | Recoverable problem, missing optional data, rejected entry, or fallback. Review the surrounding lines. |
| `CRITICAL` | The requested operation could not complete, or a serious runtime failure was caught. |
| `FATAL` | Process-ending Qt failure. |
| PID | Identifies the exact process that wrote the file. |
| Thread and optional name | Distinguishes the UI thread from readers, renderers, and minimap workers. |
| Source suffix | Development builds may include the source file and line. |

An unhandled Windows exception is logged with its exception code, address,
module path, and module-relative offset when Windows provides them. An
unhandled C++ exception or `std::terminate()` is also recorded.

## PNG color-profile warning policy

Only the exact libpng warning
`iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile` is suppressed. It is non-fatal embedded
color-profile noise and does not identify a bad tile layout or failed decode.
All other PNG warnings and errors remain logged.

If Windows reports **Bad Image** before an application window opens, the Qt
runtime or DLL loader may have failed before PZTools could install its logger.
In that case, record the DLL named by Windows and re-extract or verify the
release before changing editor preferences.

## What normal startup can look like

The editors intentionally discover and preload the complete valid Tiles
catalogue. A current 2x installation can take tens of seconds and several
gigabytes of memory. Normal logs include discovery, registration, decode
progress, loaded/missing/unresolved totals, and timing summaries.

These are different states:

- **loaded**: a readable 2x or 1x PNG was resolved and decoded;
- **missing**: neither scale could be read and a placeholder is used;
- **unresolved catalogue entry**: metadata exists but no image has yet been
  confirmed for that logical name;
- **invalid**: dimensions, grid geometry, format metadata, or encoded data
  failed a specific validation.

Do not report only a changing total. Include the nearby paths, summary, and
first warning or critical line that explains why the total changed.

WorldEd now reports its interactive startup phases after the main window has
been shown: Tilesets.txt, installed-sheet discovery, complete catalogue
preparation, Building catalog files, and thumbnail settings. A log containing
`WorldEd interactive startup tasks begin` but no corresponding completion
identifies the phase where startup is still working or failed.

Every application log now starts with a privacy-limited machine summary:

- operating system, kernel build, and CPU architecture
- CPU model and logical processor count
- total RAM and RAM available at startup
- operating-system-reported GPU/display adapters
- Qt version, Qt ABI, and process bitness

WorldEd BMP To TMX provides **Update Rules/Blends metadata only** for existing
TMX maps assigned to all world cells or only the selected cells. It replaces
the stored Rules and Blends paths, aliases, rules, and blends. Bitmap pixels,
layers, objects, tilesets, no-blend masks, and edge settings remain unchanged.
WorldEd lists the files first, skips identical snapshots, writes atomically,
and creates a dated project backup before changing any TMX file.

Older TMX files can retain unresolved tileset references. Removing only the
tilesets that no longer resolve to a PNG can reduce unnecessary rule work.
Project Doctor can inspect and repair those references with a backup.

TileZed also records a rate-limited warning when ground-brush preparation takes
40 ms or more. The line separates temporary Rules and Blends calculation from
automatic blend-tile cleanup and includes the brush bounds and active metadata
counts.

The deployed validator can measure a specific map while checking that indexed
Blends and sparse dirty regions produce the same layers as their compatibility
paths. It also verifies that the Sand rule resolves only its declared tiles
when similarly named test or custom sheets are present. When the benchmark map
contains `blends_natural_01_TEST`, the validator removes and restores that
sheet, rebuilds the automatic layers, and checks the Sand output after both
operations:

```powershell
TileZed.exe --validate-brush-performance C:\path\to\map.tmx
```

Without a TMX argument, the command runs the built-in brush, undo, Rules, and
Blends checks only.

## Reproducing a problem

1. Close unrelated PZTools instances.
2. Start the deployed executable from `PZTools-Qt5-Latest/bin`.
3. Perform the smallest sequence that reproduces the issue.
4. Close the application normally when possible.
5. Sort `settings/logs` by modification time and select the newest file for
   that application and PID.
6. Keep roughly 30 lines before and after the first relevant warning or
   critical message. Attach the complete log for a crash or startup problem.

Do not use a log from a source build directory to describe behavior observed
in a different deployed executable.

## Maintainer regression commands

Run these against the deployed binaries, where the matching Qt DLLs and
plugins are present.

### TileZed and BuildingEd

```powershell
.\TileZed.exe --validate-automapper-rules
.\TileZed.exe --validate-brush-performance
.\TileZed.exe --validate-depthmap-editor
.\TileZed.exe --validate-pack-tools
.\TileZed.exe --validate-tiledef-split
.\TileZed.exe --validate-tileset-catalog
.\BuildingEd.exe --validate-building-categories
.\BuildingEd.exe --validate-tileset-catalog
```

Data-dependent checks:

```powershell
.\TileZed.exe --validate-loot-distributions <game-root> [project-or-mod-root]
.\BuildingEd.exe --validate-loot-distributions <game-root> [project-or-mod-root]
```

GUI render checks write an explicit PNG:

```powershell
.\TileZed.exe --render-pack-comparator <output.png>
.\TileZed.exe --render-pack-extractor <output.png>
.\TileZed.exe --render-tiledef-comparator <output.png>
.\TileZed.exe --render-loot-distributions <game-root> <output.png> [project-root]
```

### PZWorldEd

```powershell
.\PZWorldEd.exe --validate-preview-overlays
.\PZWorldEd.exe --validate-biomemap-config
.\PZWorldEd.exe --validate-hole-repair
.\PZWorldEd.exe --validate-native-256-lot-geometry
.\PZWorldEd.exe --validate-streets=<streets.xml>
.\PZWorldEd.exe --validate-bmp-generation=<project.pzw>
.\PZWorldEd.exe --validate-ingamemap=<worldmap.xml>
.\PZWorldEd.exe --validate-worldgen-preview=<game-or-WorldGen-path>
.\PZWorldEd.exe --validate-worldgen-prefab-import=<source.tmx-or-tbx>
.\PZWorldEd.exe --validate-worldgen-project-overlay=<game-path>::<project-overlay-path>
.\PZWorldEd.exe --validate-world-defaults=..\config\WorldDefaults.txt
.\PZWorldEd.exe --validate-tileset-cleanup
.\PZWorldEd.exe --validate-ingamemap-forest-export
.\PZWorldEd.exe --audit-tileset-cleanup=<TMX-TBX-or-project-folder>
```

Explicit catalogue maintenance:

```powershell
.\PZWorldEd.exe --rebuild-tileset-catalog=<Tiles-path>
```

The rebuild command backs up and rewrites `Tilesets.txt`; it is not a
read-only validator and is not run during normal startup.

WorldGen render checks:

```powershell
.\PZWorldEd.exe --render-worldgen-preview=<game-or-WorldGen-path> --worldgen-preview-output=<output.png>
.\PZWorldEd.exe --render-worldgen-prefab=<game-or-WorldGen-path> --worldgen-preview-output=<output.png>
.\PZWorldEd.exe --render-worldgen-prefab-window=<game-or-WorldGen-path> --worldgen-preview-output=<output.png>
.\PZWorldEd.exe --render-tileset-cleanup=<project-folder> --worldgen-preview-output=<output.png>
```

`--validate-ingamemap` writes
`<worldmap.xml>.validated.bin`. Remove only that exact generated file after
review. Render commands overwrite only the explicitly selected output path.

Because these are Windows GUI-subsystem executables, a PowerShell invocation
may return before the process exits and may not provide a useful
`$LASTEXITCODE`. Wait for the exact process to finish and confirm the explicit
`PASS` or `FAIL` line in the newest matching log.

| `--audit-tileset-cleanup` | Read-only report for real TMX/TBX files, including missing/outside TBX dependencies; it never applies cleanup. |

## Minimum useful issue report

Include:

- application name;
- release date or commit;
- exact action and smallest reproduction sequence;
- expected and observed behavior;
- affected PZW, TMX, TBX, `.tiles`, `.pack`, PNG, Rules, or Lua path;
- project grid format, when relevant;
- newest matching log;
- screenshot for visual/layout/rendering issues;
- whether Raster and OpenGL behave differently, when renderer code is
  involved;
- whether the problem also occurs with Automapper Interactive disabled;
- whether the delay begins specifically after **BMP Tool > Import Rules** and
  **Reload**, and the matching terrain `Rules.txt` / `Blends.txt`;
- whether the file is game data, project data, or generated output.

For a performance report, also include the approximate map dimensions,
selected tool/brush size, visible docks, tileset scale, and pause duration.

## Before declaring a regression

- Confirm the executable path belongs to the current portable release.
- Confirm the log's installation root matches that release.
- Confirm the project is using the intended 300 or 256 grid.
- Confirm `config` is the catalogue directory and `settings` is not.
- Confirm the Tiles path points to the parent Tiles tree, not to an unrelated
  extracted folder.
- For Automapper, confirm the TMX is saved and use
  `automapping-rules.txt`; press **Reload** after correcting a rule.
- For WorldGen or loot editing, confirm the game path is read-only and the
  project output is outside the game installation.
