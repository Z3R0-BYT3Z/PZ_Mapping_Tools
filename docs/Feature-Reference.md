## File ownership

| Basement access TBX, TMX, and PZBY | Portable `pzby_tbx` beside `bin` | Read-only source and compiled access catalogue |

## Current limits

- WorldGen preview output is representative rather than save-identical.
- Static WorldGen prefabs use the supported level-zero schematic format.
- Loot editing does not define items, icons, sandbox settings, or vehicles.
- Pack tools do not merge or patch source packs.
- TileDef merge does not invent missing tilesets or resize source sheets.
